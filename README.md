# AntiTLDAbuserFilterlist
A filterlist for AdBlock Plus compatible filterlists that will warn you from visiting websites that are using those mostly and probably abused TLDs. 

## Our definition of "Probably Abused TLDs"
This means that it is a TLD that is not mostly bused now but there is a probability that it will be abused, like the new .zip TLD that Google is offering.

## Our Definition of "Mostly Abused TLDs"
It is the TLDs that are commonly abused but not those very commonly accessed ones like .gov, .edu, .com, .net, .biz, .org and similar ones. You don't want to be warned when visiting github.com, linux.org 
or even google.com right?

## Our Sources of those TLDs under that category
It is the reputable sources on the internet like Spamhouse.org.

## License Agreement

## What is even a TLD?
It stands for Top-Level domain and it is described as the first outer component of a domain or simply the last word after the period (like .com or .org).

## Our definition of "abused"
It means that they are TLDs that are used in spams, scams, phishing and hacking.

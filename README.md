# AntiTLDAbuserFilterlist
A filterlist for AdBlock Plus compatible filterlists that will prevent and stop you (not completely stop) from visiting websites that are using those mostly and probably abused TLDs. 

## Our definition of "Probably Abused TLDs"
This means that it is a TLD that is not mostly bused now but there is a probability that it will be abused, like the new .zip TLD that Google is offering.

## Our Definition of "Mostly Abused TLDs"
It is the TLDs that are commonly abused but not those common ones like .com, .org, .gov, .net and more, because you don't want to be blocked on accessing google.com right?
